- A video game like Island Troll Tribes, you are a gatherer. You walk around, you find items that spawn randomly on the map. When you see them they are easy to see (glowy). They are not too hard to find. You have infinite backpack. The GUI starts very simple, you have nothing. You have Skill Gatherer, level 1. You only get to see Tinder and Flint. As you gather those materials, you increase your level. You get to gather new materials. You end up building a axe, cut wood, build a house. You start on a medium island with no predators. You build a raft. You get to other islands. Some inhabited. Some with predators. Some small, some huge.
- TODO: Check all my previous projects, and get at least a picture and a small description.
